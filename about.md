Inspired in artistic movements related to tool hacking, social media and
massive access to image and sound production softwares, **BlackCodedMIDI**
proposes an exploration of the relationship between image and sound by
expanding _Black MIDI_ genre with scripts in different programming languages. 

Narrative scope of short animations, visual and sound rhythm patterns generated
with abstract shader compositions, pattern generation via formulas or live
coding techniques, and spoken word to MIDI are some of the artistic searches
that we intend to deepen.

We aim to develop an online collaborative editor to live code and generate MIDI
scores into our **BlackCodedMIDI** device, encouraging remote cooperative art
making.
