As creative code enthusiasts we want to appropriate Black MIDI aesthetic
resource with a strong ludic and experimental approach to update and expand it
by hybridizing it with several technologies via different programming languages
and tools. We want to explore the image and sound relationship, focusing on
each one. 

We developed a script in Python that allows automatic image to MIDI conversion,
enabling us to use any video source as input to get MIDI sequences in a score,
which will work as frames in a tape, by reproducing it with Mido and Pygame
(Python libraries to read/send MIDI data and to create a visual interface,
respectively). Our device output reminds of antique stroboscopic animations.

There has been several artistic movements/phenomena in the recent past that
approached art from a hacking perspective by pushing production tools'
boundaries.

The demoscene in the 90s was characterized by crackers who
looked for hardware and software limitations of computers and videogame
consoles to create optimized programs for musical and visual composition, and
later, work with error as aesthetic resource.

with a socialized internet and established platforms for social interaction and content creation a new wave of artists appeared in the 2000s, using online and free software tools to manipulate and hack digital material such as glitch art (with digital image techniques as data bending and data moshing, or digital music genres as click&cuts or glitch hop).

Among other new cultural manifestations, we are especially interested in Black
MIDI. Arised in social media, this artistic practice was born in 2009 when
Shirasagi Yukki uploaded to Nico Nico Douga (a japanese video-sharing service
similar to YouTube) a video of a reinterpreted version of a popular videogame
song, composed with a high number of MIDI notes (piece intended to be executed
by devices, not piano/keyboard human players). Also known as blackened musical
notation due to the black note head stains in a score (if translating MIDI to
pentagram), this practice articulates both visual and sound aspect. The MIDI
notes flow down the screen and activates the notes of an horizontal piano roll,
located at the bottom, producing moving visual patterns. By virtue of this
activation, sound is perceived, sometimes as rhythm, melody and harmony and
sometimes as a dense, homogenic timbre, due to clusters created by note
duplication and addition processes. Both visual and sound aspects were
thoroughly explored by the increasing number of people who started producing
and uploading their own Black MIDI videos and organizing virtual challenges.
